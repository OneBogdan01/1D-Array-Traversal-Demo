### Summary
A simple visual demonstration of traversing a 1-dimensional array using typical 2-dimensional array index values, such as row and column.

### Motivation
Primarily to assist a friend with a tutorial where this method is explained.
But will also hopefully be useful to anyone that's having a hard time with it.

### Use
It basically generates a looping animation that is completely described by this gif:

Literally just copy the gif and you can save yourself the time of running the project yourself.
